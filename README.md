## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Initialize a project
Let's create a new directory where our folder will go.

```
❯ mkdir basic-demo
❯ cd basic-demo
```

Now we can use Gradle’s init command to generate a simple project. We will explore everything that is generated so you know exactly what’s going on.

```
❯ gradle init 
//Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)
```
The command should show "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and generate the following "empty" project. If it doesn’t, please ensure that Gradle is installed properly, and that you have the JAVA_HOME environment variable set correctly.


This is what Gradle generated for you.

```
├── build.gradle  
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar  
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties  
├── gradlew  
├── gradlew.bat  
└── settings.gradle 
```

 1 Gradle build script for configuring the current project
 2 Gradle Wrapper executable JAR
 3 Gradle Wrapper configuration properties
 4 Gradle Wrapper script for Unix-based systems
 5 Gradle Wrapper script for Windows
 6 Gradle settings script for configuring the Gradle build
