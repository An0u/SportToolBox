# Contribution

Thank you very much for contributing.

## How to?

* Please fork the project
* Work on the code in the fork
* Create Pull Request to the main project

### Testing

If you implement or change code, please run the tests so we can avoid regression. Prefably create tests before working on the code. It is also possible to create tests without adding new code.

### Working on issues

Please comment on the issues before start working on them. This way nobody is wasting time trying to achieve the same thing.

### Coding

Please use Java Coding Conventions so the code is easily readable for everbody.
